# IP Checker

IP Checker is an application for checking the response codes of IPs when making GET requests to iPlayer through those IPs.

## Purpose

This application supports a local business I reached out to (referred to as '2xs'), by shortening their workflow which used to involve checking each IP manually using SSH.

## Usage

This application is useless without the private keys (which are redacted) and the passphrases (which you probably don't have).
I am currently hosting this application on [Heroku](http://ips-2xs.herokuapp.com/) without the keys being redacted.
If you have the passphrases, put them in the appropriate boxes, paste the IPs into the IP box, and hit 'Submit'.

## Returns

Unless you have the passphrases you won't be able to see this application in action, so I have attached a screenshot showing some of the values that can be returned.
